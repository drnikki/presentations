Hello, SandCamp 2013!

In this folder is everything that was discussed/shared/tested during my testing presentation.

For your reference, the demo site and other assets are available at
sandcamp2013.drnikki.org


### Download Selenium
1. http://seleniumhq.org/download/

2. Restart Firefox.  (Tools > Add-Ons)





### Getting a local test site
The stored files for the site are just a make file and a db import.  There aren't really too many special features on the site.

By the way, if you haven't seen http://drushmake.me/, yo.  get on it
