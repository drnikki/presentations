         female chief information officers--the top IT rank at most companies--increased to 9% in 2007, up from 7% in 2000 (Forbes.com, Rachel Rosmarin, 05.17.07, http://www.forbes.com/2007/05/16/power-women-technology-tech-cx_rr_0517techwomen.html).

          "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything," released in October 2009 by Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress found that, for the first time in American history, women are half of all workers outside the home and mothers are the primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in nearly two-thirds of American families.

           Of 321 large global enterprises—companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue—surveyed in a Forbes study in 2011, 85 percent agreed or strongly agreed that diversity is crucial to fostering innovation in the workplace.

        <h3>IT'S GOOD FOR MONEY</h3>
        Research indicates that investing in women as tech entrepreneurs is good for the bottom line. Venture-backed start-ups run by women use, on average, 40 percent less capital than start-ups run by men and are increasingly involved in successful initial public offerings of stock, according to a recent white paper by Cindy Padnos, a venture capitalist who compiled data from 100 studies on gender and tech entrepreneurship.  “When you have gender diversity in an organization, you have better innovation, and I don’t know where innovation is more important than in the high-tech world,” says Ms. Padnos, who recently founded Illuminate Ventures, which invests in start-ups led by women.

        <h3>IT'S GOOD FOR SCIENCE and MONEY</h3>

        - patents cited more often
        - greater ROI in IT companies with female directors

        For those with a bottom-line approach, analysts say it makes a difference when women are in the garages where tech start-ups are founded or the boardrooms where they are funded. Studies have found that teams with both women and men are more profitable and innovative. Mixed-gender teams have produced information technology patents that are cited 26 percent to 42 percent more often than the norm, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. In a study analyzing the relationship between the composition of corporate boards and financial performance, Catalyst, a research organization on women and business, found a greater return on investment, equity and sales in I.T. companies that have directors who are women.

          One of those changes is making it clear that women (and other minorities) are not just tolerated in public spaces, but that they are explicitly wanted there.

          <h3>unrecognized priveliges</h3>
          Being praised for the content of your writing rather than the neatness of your handwriting.

          Never being asked by a job interviewer whether you would mind being the first employee of your gender in the company.

          Just stick to the facts.  YOu're too emotional.

            plaiddogdesign: @webchick best way to experiment with Drupal is locally. If Mac install MAMP if PC install WAMP. MAMP has a free version. I use it for dev.
            hypaticadotca: @plaiddogdesign psst, she's a core drupal committer. I think she knows how to install it :)

          <h3>And who will come after us?</h3>
          In the mid-1980s women earned 36% of the bachelor’s degrees in computer science; by 2006 that number had dropped to 20%.
          http://www.womenintechnology.org/witef/resources

          But the biggest change appears to be at Harvard. In the 2009-10 academic year, 13 percent of computer science majors were women, prompting the most "gender-skewed" moniker from the student-run Harvard Crimson. In the 2010-11 academic year, which just came to a close, 25 percent of computer science majors were women.
